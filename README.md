# Food Calorie Detection Application using GoogleNet

This application is designed to detect and estimate the calorie content of various foods using GoogleNet, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The model has been trained on over 100 different types of foods and can accurately identify and estimate the calories present in those foods based on input images.

## Features

- **Food Recognition:** Utilizes GoogleNet's trained model to recognize over 100 different types of foods.
- **Calorie Estimation:** Estimates the approximate calorie content of the recognized food items.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to upload images and receive calorie estimations.
